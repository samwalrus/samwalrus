I am a motivated and skilled software developer and bioinformatician with a passion for Artificial Intelligence and its impact on society. My current role is post doctoral researcher at Cardiff University. I am particularly interested in the intersection of causal reasoning in logic and epidemiology, such as through the use of Mendelian randomization. I have a strong background in R and Python programming languages and am always looking to expand my knowledge and skillset by learning new technologies and collaborating with like-minded individuals. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and exploring the great outdoors, as well as having a particular fondness for nature, especially walruses and basset hounds. If you're interested in working on a project together or have any questions about my work, please don't hesitate to contact me via email, LinkedIn, or Gitthub. Happy to go for a beer and talk science anytime.
